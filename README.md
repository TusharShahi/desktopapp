The application enables the user to manage all the workers in a college campus. 
One can add a new building which can either be a mess, a hostel block or an academic block.
The user can then define the number of workers of each type needed for that particular building, for each slot of the day.
There are five slots in a day.
There are six types of workers which are required in a college campus - a electrician, a chef, a cleaner, a carpenter, a guard or a gardener.
Also, the user can add a new worker, and his various details and then allot him work according to the five slots of a day.
The user can click on a building and see if the building requires any worker and then allot the work accordingly.
